GNW : Architecture for the Global Neuronal Workspace

STDP_Reward : Izhikevich's synpase model

XOR.ipynb : Sandbox for XOR function

Digits : Sandbox for MNIST digits recognition

ReinforceSynapse : Izhikevich's 2007 paper first experiment to test his model. In a large network of neurons, we artificially release dopamine when the synapse between neurons 0 and 1 is activated. The goal is to check that this synapse actually reinforces itself.

PavlovianConditioning : Izhikevich's 2007 paper second experiment to test his model. We have different groups of neurons, and one of them is different : when some neuron of this group is activated, we release dopamine. The goal is to check that synapses coming from this group actually are more reinforced than the other ones.
